Experimentation
1.Both ways make the image more blurry. Changing sigma doesn't create as 
much of a change becuase in the equation it is in the denominator. N has
more of an effect on making the image more blurry because it is the size
of the kernel.
2.Sobel bascially makes the image black and white because it makes
all the edges white and the rest black through edge detection.
3.Unblurring a blurred image using un-sharp does not return the original
image. Because blur(IM) has to be passed into the unsharp equation but you 
can't take blur on a already blurred image.
