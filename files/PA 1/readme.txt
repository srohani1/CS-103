CSCI 103 Programming Assignment 1, Hailstone

Name: Alec Lord

Email Address: alord@usc.edu

:Between the lab, the homework, and this PA, I went to many office hours. 
I don't specifcally remember all of the TA's and CP's that I met, but I 
basically met all of them. They were all extremely helpful, but Adam 
just really sticks out in my mind for some reason.

================================ Questions ==================================

1. I used a while loop becuase I wanted the loop to continue iterating
 untill the number becomes one, because that means that the hailstone 
 procedure is complete.In order words to keep looping while the condtion
 is true and stop when it becomes false.


  input range  | minimum length | achieved by | maximum length | achieved by
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    50 100     |      6         |    64       |    118         |97             
   100 200     |      7         |    128      |    124         |171            
   200 400     |      8         |    256      |    143         |327

:The minimum values are all factors of 2. This is because once the number 
is even the procedure just calls for dividing it by 2 over and over till 1.
If it is odd it require other arithmetic such as multpyling.They always end 
is 8 4 2 1.

3a. 

X is : 703

3b. 

:I started with a large range of 1-1000. Which gave me the maximum 
length value with 871. So I did 500-870 and got 703 as the number with 
the maximum length. I then tried 500-702 which didn't give me a number 
with a length greater than 150 so i figured it was 703. To be sure I tried
1-703 and I got 703 as the smallest integer with length greater than 150.

================================ Remarks ====================================

:I spent approximately 5 hours on this asignment, with TA and CP help.

:I beleive everything I turned in works properly. I initally had some 
trouble trying to figure out how to go about each problem, but the TA's
 and CP's helped me through it.

:I like this PA. I think it was a good exercise to start with.
