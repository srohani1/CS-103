Number of simulations |Resulting Average
----------------------------------------
       100            | 3.54                   
       1,000          | 3.5               
       10,000         | 3.519  
       100,000        | 3.527                  
       1,000,000      | 3.521                        

The point of diminishing returns is 100,000 simulations. Any more 
simulations than this only decreases response time and does not 
significantly improve accuracy.
